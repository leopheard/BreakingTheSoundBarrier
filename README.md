<a href="kodi.tv">KODI<a> / XBMC / Firestick addon for the <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/">Breaking The Sound Barrier</a> podcast by Amy Goodman.<br>

Goodman and Moynihan report each week on the people and places caught in the middle, the ones most directly affected by policy debates, war and social issues. The column breaks through the glib clichés, dogmatic language and overall static that has permeated mainstream media coverage. Goodman and Moynihan’s unrestrained commentary from the front lines resonates with a generation that has an uncanny ability to spot the inauthentic in any discourse.<br>
